        <span>Amsterdam</span> is the capital and most populous city of the     Netherlands, with The Hague being the seat of government. It has a
        population of 921,402 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan
        area. Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the "Venice of the North", for its large number of canals, now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

          The Anne Frank House (Dutch: Anne Frank Huis) is a writer's house and biographical museum dedicated to Jewish wartime
          diarist Anne Frank. The building is located on a canal called the Prinsengracht, close to the Westerkerk, in central
          Amsterdam in the Netherlands. <br> <br>During World War II, Anne Frank hid from Nazi persecution with her family and four other people in hidden rooms, in the
          rear building, of the 17th-century canal house, later known as the Secret Annex (Dutch: Achterhuis). She did not survive
          the war but her wartime diary was published in 1947. Ten years later the Anne Frank Foundation was established to
          protect the property from developers who wanted to demolish the block.

          The most well-known neighborhood in the city, the Jordaan is one of the top places to see in Amsterdam. Built in the
          17th century, its buildings still maintain much of their historic character thanks to careful renovation and
          preservation efforts.
          
          The Jordaan is now one of the trendiest areas in the city. It’s filled with galleries, eclectic shops, restaurants, and
          bars making some of the best cocktails I’ve had in Europe. Though many of the tenants have changed, you can still get a
          sense of Amsterdam’s history at places like Cafe Papeneiland, a brown cafe that dates from 1642 (and, incidentally,
          serves some killer Dutch apple pie).
